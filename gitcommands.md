# basic git commands

- `git init`:
  - initalizes git repositories 
- `git status`:
  - checks status of file in the git directory
  - shows different untracked, added, modified files
- `git add filename1 filename2 ... filenameN`
  - adds different files to the staging area 
  - only the specefic files are added to staging
  - this process is done before capturing commit
  - commit is a screenshot of code changes
  - staged files are for temp memory
- `git add .`
  - adds all the files to the staging area 
- `git commit -m "commit message"`
  - captures the screenshot of the code 
  - this is for taking note of code
  - at some crutial points when code is to be saved, it is saved using commit message
  - different code ss can be visited using hash
  - __hash__ is a string which denotes some ss 
  - `b352504c73134a1088eeb449761e2c1f5cea1eb7` is an example of hash
- `git log`
  - shows all the commit history 
  - commit history includes author, hash, time, commit messages, and other details regarding  commits
- `git log --oneline`
  - gives a concise commit history
  - a short hash and commit message
- `git push -u branchname`
  - pushes the code to online servers 
  - `-u` is for upstream flag
    - used only for the first time
    - afterwards without `-u` also the code get pushed
    - `-u` is a shortcut flag for `--upstream`
  - `git push`
    - works after the first time
    - for the first time we use `-u` flag
- `git pull`
  - pulls all the code from the server
  - gets the code from other devs as well
